UPDATE 2017
===========

Fuck with this and fuck even with that [TEAMOCIL - automatically create windows and panes in TMUX with configuration from YAML files!](http://andilabs.github.io/teamocil/tmux/terminal/utility/os-x/mac-os-x/devops/2015/02/07/osx-tmux-configuration-fiels-with-setting-magical-teamocil.html)

lets use iTermocil
------------------

Found this tool. It is really cool! Purely in iTerm and with yaml's as a config:

I wonder that for so long time I was doing it manually

1. Open terminal
2. navigate to projects directory
3. open project in SublimeText
4. activate virtualenv
5. run development server
6. open Chrome to watch whats happens

2-6 is just about pasting all commands you need seperated by `&&` or `|` or `|&` or `;` [what should I choose? Read here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5130889/953553)

	cd mbf && open -a Sublime\ Text . && source ~/.virtualenvs/spots/bin/activate  && open -a Google\ Chrome http://127.0.0.1:8000 && python manage.py runserver --settings=mbf.settings.andi

to execute into `Send text at start`:

what is quite nice you can build multiple such profiles. You can start them in new windows or new tabs of iTerm.

to be extended
--------------

using some terminal multiplexer
