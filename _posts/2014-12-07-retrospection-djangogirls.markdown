Retrospection
=============

linguistic disclousure: Why the all the stuff here is written in english?

Not because writing blog in english is 1000+ to fame ;) It is because of several reasons:

getting used to using all the technical terms and jarrgon, which is in english helps to learn all IT-technologies much faster. You can read docs of programming languages, libraries, question and answers on different forums, especially [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/), ask there your own questions if you get lost.

I would love to see one day a djangogrils graduate with worldwide (==start in english) startup!

Be open to the world of opprtunities, you are in IT, which can be made globally!

First of all great thanks to [Justyna Kałużka]() and [Marta Matros]() for prepering awesome event!

I am also very glad to be coach of awesome clever and ambitious girls and hopefully future programmers. You were really brave! And don't worry about all the bugs, which apperad by the way, because as said in this poster:

I am aware, that amount of konwledge, which was provided while this less or more 1,5 day workshopp was for sure a bit overhmelling, thatsway I thought it will be cool to provide some summary of what we was talking about, and especially to HIGHLIGHT the parts we skipped or go trought very fast and provide some linkt, to intresting tutorials, cursoes being great extension.


	We begun with setup of all the needed tools. Choice of right tools for project development and then for so called "productional" deployment (putting it life on server to show it whole world) is really crucial. Using right tools can save you a lot of time and frustration.

		we setup python installing the 3.4 version

		we setup virtualenv to make our development environment clean, isolated and easy to replicate by others (thanks to requirments file - do you remember what was its role?)


	We really deal with topic of `Python` very, very roughly. The best way to learn it if you are self-studing is choosing http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python
