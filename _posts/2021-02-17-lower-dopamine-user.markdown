## short list

1. remove all the social media apps, dont fool yourself you need it for communication, relationships, bla bla.
2. turn off as much off notifications as possible. Really checking your email few times a day is perfectly fine. 
3. clean your start screen. I ended up with:
 * camera, 
 * weather, 
 * calendar, 
 * Noisli (sounds for better focus), 
 * JakDojade (local path finder), 
 * Google Maps, 
 * Gmail, 
 * Drive, 
 * Calculator, 
 * AdobeScan, 
 * Desk Control (sti stand desk control)
 * Clock
 * Translate app
