What is Vagrant
===============

	Vagrant is tool allowing easy start of virtual machines for development. Mostly we think about Linux. The machine has no GUI only command line. It uses virtualbox as virtualatization backend. It is avaliable for all platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux.


Motivation for using Vagrant
============================

	- We save time lost on configuring stuff and learning how to run it on Windows, which anyway for Python/Django won't a production server never-ever.

	- We are in 1:1 Linux World, where girls hopefully one day will end-up anyway configuring their production server on some cloud or whererever mostly it will be Linux, which mostly will be avaliable only from command line interface.

	- Installing and configuring all the stuff on Linux is much easier.

	- The coaches can support the workshop participants much better, because they are using Linux on daily basis.
