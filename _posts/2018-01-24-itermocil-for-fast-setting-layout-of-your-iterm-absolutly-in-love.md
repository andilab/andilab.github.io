title: "Itermocil \U0001F60D magic tool for iTerm"

In the past I made several attempts inspired by linux tools like tmux, byobu etc to have  predefined terminal shell layouts which can be setup with one click. But this didn't work very cool. And here is the tool that makes the difference for all iTerm users.
