I was thinking about right choice for bloging platform/tool, such, which will:

* not require from me dozens of configurations, setting up database, extra hosting
* will offer me beatiful possiblites of formating text just by indendtation, without any need of HTML
* will offer nice coloring of the source codes in different programming languages

I have choosen [jekyll] which you can easily host as [github] site. Jekyll uses [markdown] that is the same coloring, formating richness which you can find for example while writing stackoverflow question/answer or writing your documentation using [sphinx]. You can even make edits from github.com as CMS so there is huge portability. It will be build on github's server.

[sphinx]:	http://sphinx-doc.org/

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name):
  return "Hi, #{name}"

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
