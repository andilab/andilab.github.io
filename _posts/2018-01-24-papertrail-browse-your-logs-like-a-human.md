title: Papertrail - browse your logs like a human

# Papertrail
How anyoing is ssh to the server, navigating to the certain logs file and cat, heading, tailing, or greping from shell? For me quite a lot, so I gave a try to papertrail to have access to my logs live from the web browser. This tool just works, is easy to configure and use your logs like a human do!
