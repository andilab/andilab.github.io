What about getting your README files red by computer?

On OS X  in Terminal you can execute:


`say < README.md`

if you need to read it in another language than your default (I have for example configured polish language as default, because I like to have long newspaper articles red, but most docs I read is in english), just execute specifing the voice choice:

`say -v Alex < README.md`
